## Spring MVC

These docs are under construction!

In the meantime, please refer to the [dropwizard](../dropwizard) docs for broad context and getting started.

Note that the `framework` for Spring MVC is `"spring-mvc"`, so using that in your Maven, Gradle, or SBT plugin configuration should get you started.
